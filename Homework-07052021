Task1:
Create a directory in your home directory called projects. In the projects
directory, create nine empty fi les that are named house1, house2, house3, and so on to house9. Assuming there are lots of other fi les in that directory, come up with a single argument to ls that would list just those nine files.

home$ sudo mkdir projects
home$ cd projects/
home/projects$ sudo touch house{1..9}
home/projects$ ls *house*
house1  house2  house3  house4  house5  house6  house7  house8  house9


Task2:
Make the $HOME/projects/houses/doors/ directory path. Create the following empty fi les within this directory path (try using absolute and relative paths from your home directory):
$HOME/projects/houses/bungalow.txt
$HOME/projects/houses/doors/bifold.txt
$HOME/projects/outdoors/vegetation/landscape.txt

home/projects$ sudo mkdir houses
home/projects/houses$ sudo touch /home/projects/houses/bungalow.txt      # absolute
home/projects/houses$ sudo mkdir ./doors                                 # relative
home/projects/houses/doors$ sudo touch ./bifold.txt                      
home/projects/houses$ cd ..
home/projects$ sudo mkdir ./outdoors
home/projects/outdoors$ sudo mkdir ./vegetation
home/projects/outdoors/vegetation$ sudo touch ./landscape.txt


Task3:
Copy the files house1 and house5 to the $HOME/projects/houses/ directory.

home/projects$ sudo cp -r house1 ./houses/
home/projects$ sudo cp -r house5 ./houses/

Task4:
Remove the files house6, house7, and house8 without being prompted.

home/projects$ sudo rm ./house{6..8}
